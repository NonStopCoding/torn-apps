Sick of using a calculator to enter payout amounts and multiplying it by there kills ($250,000 x 100) well i did so i built this little handy script that handles all the math
for you all you need to do is enter the amount of cash per kill and how many kills and below it will show you the total cost for that person.

Uses HTML FOR DESIGN AND INPUT FIELDS
Used CSS to style the application
Uses Jquery to calculate the amount by kills and display it below.

This script is free to use and open source you may fork the github or download it and place it on your web host / wamp server
